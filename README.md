## About: 
Search for trending topics on Twitter worldwide! Click on any country on the map to view the top 3 trending topics on Twitter in that country. Map library used is Leaflet for Javascript. Twitter API is used to first fetch the nearest country where trending data is available based on the given latitude and longitude. Then, trending topics are fetched based on the country.
### Limitations:
Some locations (for example, in the middle of an ocean) are invalid. Other locations (for example, in countries where Twitter data isn't available) might show topics that are trending in neighbouring countries.
